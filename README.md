fist I created the book class and added the attributes
then I created the 2 book objects then had it print the descriptions of the two books then had it mark one of the books as read
then I had it create the ebook class with classic books that are avalible for purchase then a function to buy books then a function to view the purchased book then a function to mark the books as already read
Then i added an example using two of the books that were avalible for purchase
